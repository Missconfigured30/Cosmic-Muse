# 🌌 Cosmic Muse

### *Where thoughts float like stars…*

Cosmic Muse is a space-inspired journaling and note-capturing Android application that I built while learning mobile app development.

This project is very close to me because it is my **first complete Android app** — developed from scratch during my learning phase. I didn’t just want to build a notes app… I wanted to build a *feeling* — something calm, cosmic, and personal.

So Cosmic Muse became my little universe where thoughts can exist freely ✨

## 🚀 The Idea Behind Cosmic Muse

Sometimes thoughts feel bigger than words — like constellations forming slowly in the mind.

I wanted an app where writing feels peaceful instead of mechanical.
No clutter. No noise. Just you… and your thoughts… floating in space.

* Dreamers 🌙
* Writers ✍️
